# Quote Generator

This is a front end project built as part of FreeCodeCamp's cirriculum. The website displays quotes to the user from five different arrays depending on the source and its author. The user can either click on the 'Generate New Quote' button or press the spacebar. The user can also press a button to tweet the quote. The array is randomized every time they change arrays and it loops over itself.

I displayed the data with Angular during the revision and experimented with using different sources for quotes and allowing users to pick those sources. I also experimented with changing color schemes depending on which sources were picked, but that didn't work when I decided users could have more than one source for quotes. I also wanted something where users can add quotes, but I think that's a future project at this point.

## To Do 

* Change the color scheme depending on the source of the quotes
	This probably won't work since I'm using a filter system unlike before where I was using only one source.

## User Stories

### FreeCodeCamp

* User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
* User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

### Personal User Stories

* User Story: I can also press the space bar to get a new quote.
* User Story: I can filter which sources I want my quotes to come from.
* User Story: I can click on a link to see the wikipedia page for the person who said the quote. 

## Built With

* [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) - Used to display data.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Used to change HTML classes and other little things that I didn't need to rewrite functions for. 
* [FontAwesome] (https://fontawesome.com/) - Used for various icons. Love these guys.

## Acknowledgments

* I own none of these quotes of course. I pulled mainly from the Elder Scrolls, Civilization, Discworld, and Darkest Dungeon series with Last of Us, Bioshock, and the Protomen filling up the majority of the miscellaneous section.
