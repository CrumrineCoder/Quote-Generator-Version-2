# Quote Generator

This is a front end project built as part of FreeCodeCamp's cirriculum. The website displays quotes to the user from five different arrays depending on the source and its author. The user can either click on the 'Generate New Quote' button or press the spacebar. The user can also press a button to tweet the quote. The array is randomized every time they change arrays and it loops over itself. I used Angular.JS to display the data. 

## To Do 

* Change the color scheme depending on the source of the quotes

## User Stories

### FreeCodeCamp

* User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

### Personal User Stories
